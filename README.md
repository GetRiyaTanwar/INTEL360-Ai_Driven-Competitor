## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run INSIGHT IQ on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GetRiyaTanwar/INTEL360-Ai_Driven-Competitor.git
    cd INTEL360-Ai_Driven-Competitor
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Google Cloud Credentials:**

    *   **Enable the Gemini API:** Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and enable the Gemini API.
    *   **Create API Key:** Create an API key and store it securely.
    *   **Set Environment Variable:** Set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable:

        ```bash
        export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"  # Linux/macOS
        set GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"  # Windows
        ```
        Or create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
        ```

        ***Important:***  Do not commit your API key to the repository!

5.  **Download spaCy Model:**

    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

6.  **Run the Streamlit Application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    This will open the application in your web browser.


## Code Structure

*   `app.py`: Main Streamlit application file containing the UI and core logic.
*   `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
*   `faiss_indexes/`: Directory to store FAISS indexes (created dynamically).
*   `INSIGHT IQ LOGO.png`: The application logo image.
*   `.env`: (Optional) File to store environment variables (like the API key).  Make sure to add this file to your `.gitignore`.
